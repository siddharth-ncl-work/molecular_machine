# Investigation of Motions in Molecular Machines
Aim of the project is to investigate the motions in molecular machines using DFT (Ruchi's Project)

## Steps:
* Model the system
* Simulate the system
* Create Code to analyse rotatation, translation and other physical quantities
* Analyse the output of the simulation in terms of above mentioned physical quantities
